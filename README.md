make a repository on your git hub account clone this lab into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code
You will be writing your code in the `index.js` file and running the tests by
running `node index.js` in the terminal.

lets get started
## STEP 1:
 Define a function ( gradeCalculator), set it to a function (arguments - score and total) and f
{ Function body }

## Step 2:
 We calculate the percentage, 

## Step 3:
 We determine the letter grade to be assigned to different score ranges. We will do this by using multiple- IF- Statement eg 
 if (percent >79) {
    letterGrade = "A"
now repeat this process untill you are done with the grades.

## Step 4:
 We return a message showing the letter grade and the score obtained using Return statement  
 return `you got ${letterGrade} ${percent}`
}

## Step 5: 
now you are done use node index.js on your terminal to run your code.
